About the game:

This is an old arcade game made for the Atari 2600 in wich we must find three pieces of and unr and try to escape from the mansion avoiding the ghost of the old owner, a giant spider and a flock of bats.

Items:

Pieces of urn - you must collect all three pieces and escape from the mansion to win the game.

Key - allows you to open locked doors (only present in dark mode game mode).

Scepter - makes you immune to giant spider and bats.

Enemies:

Giant Spider: he's the slowest enemy.

Ghost: the ghost of Zachary Graves, the old wonner of the mansion, he's the fastest enemy and is not affeccted by the scepter's magic.

Bat(s): up to three. They will steal the item you bring with you and hide it in a random spot of the mansion. 

Game Settings:

I made available three difficulty levels which change the locations of stairs and in dark mode even the lockerd doors.

You can play with lights turned on or off. Locked doors are only available if playing with lights off.

Two graphics modes: original graphics or new graphics, which changes the tiles of the walls in every floor of the mansion.

Number of bats: you can set the number of bats from 1 to 3, adding difficulty to your game.

About the project:

This project took me about one year, with the spare time I had in the weekends. If I could go back I would have decided to develop the game for other platforms.
Memory limitations and absence of a debugger for arduboy was a real pain. Not counting that the online emulator that I used in the first part, suddenly stopped to work and and I was never able to use it again.

About the code:

In short, it's not very good and not well written, I made available the source code (please don't beat me!) if someone wants to dip his fingers in this big mess. I planned to include more features such as random generation of doors and stairs, but then I realized I had run out of space so I discarded the idea (the code is still present but commented out).
